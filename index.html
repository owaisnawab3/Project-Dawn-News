        <strong>
       <p>The United States announced on Friday it was <a class="line" href="">revoking the designation</a> of Yemen’s<br> Houthi rebels as a terrorist group effective February 16, a reversal by the Biden<br>administration which was welcomed by the United Nations and humanitarian<br>groups who feared former president Donald Trump’s actions would impede aid<br>deliveries to the conflict-torn country facing the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.</p>
        </strong>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="para">
        <p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called President Joe Biden’s decision to rescind<br> the designation “a recognition of the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen”. He said<br> the new US administration listened to warnings from the United Nations, humanitarian<br> groups, bipartisan members of Congress and others “that the designations could<br> have a devastating impact on Yemenis’ access to basic commodities like food<br> and fuel”.</p>
           <p>Yemen imports 90 per cent of its food, nearly all purchased through commercial<br>channels, and UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock warned last month that the US<br>designation of the Houthis already had companies pulling back from dealing with the<br>Yemenis and would likely lead to “a large-scale famine on a scale that we have not<br>seen for nearly 40 years”.</p>
           <p>Blinken’s announcement followed a phone conversation on Thursday with UN<br>Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, where Yemen was one of the issues they<br>discussed. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric on Friday called the US action “extremely<br>positive”. “We hope that helps build momentum for a political solution to the conflict<br>in Yemen,” Dujarric said. “I think the reversal of the designation, the naming of the [US]<br>special envoy [for Yemen], and the clear, clear language from the top of the<br>administration, from president Biden himself, expressing his strong support for the UN-<br>led mediation process [...] are very, very welcome indeed.”</p>
            <p>2014, the rebel Houthis overran the capital, Sanaa, and much of Yemen’s north,<br>driving the government into exile. A US-backed, Saudi-led coalition intervened the<br>following year to try and restore the internationally recognised government, but years<br>of UN efforts to get bothsides to agree to a ceasefire and start peace negotiations<br>have not succeeded. The conflict has been disastrous for Yemen, the Arab world’s<br>poorest country, killing more than 112,000 people, creating a humanitarian disaster,<br>and wrecking infrastructure from roads and hospitals to water and electricity<br>networks.
            </p>
            <p>The State Department confirmed last week that Biden was moving to revoke the<br>designation, a day after the president announced an end to offensive support to<br>Saudi Arabia’s campaign against the Houthis.</p>
